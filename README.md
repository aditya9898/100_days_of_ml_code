# 100_days_of_ml_code
Attempting the #100_days_of_ml_code challenge inspired by Siraj Raval. Will be writing my thoughts at the end of the day, here. All the code can be found in the './code' folder.

# Day 1 (Aug 2)
Revised tensorflow from scratch. Created a program to train a model on the fashion-mnist data set. However not being able to train for over a few epochs. Working on it. code in the 'code' folder.

# Day 2
Attained 96% accuracy on the fashion-mnist dataset and debugged tensorflow code. Code to the working ipnb linked below.

# Day 3
Attended the ml code jam workshop conducted by Google. Learnt about tf.estimators and intro to tensorflow.

# Day 4
Revised keras modes and made a 3 layer conv model to fit the fashion mnist dataset. Attained 90% accuracy on both test and train sets. Have to learn why batch normalization affects the training of conv nets so much.

# Day 5
Created a convolutional neural net in tensorflow and trained a model on the fashion-mnist dataset. A few errors left to debug. Once finnished, will do an analysis on which architecture is best suited to train a model on fashion-mnist.  Code will be uploaded in the ./code folder.

# Day 6
Spent the whole day debugging tensorflow conv net code. When making conv nets in tf, we initialize the weight variables(w1,w2,w3) but tf automatically manages the bias and fully connected layer weights. After training how to return these parameters so as to make predictions on new data? 

# Day 7
Learnt transfer learning using keras. Tried using different models such as ResNet50 and MobileNet. Froze the initial layers and trained the final layers to make a smiling/not smiling classifier using MobileNet. Also worked on google colaboratory and used transfer learning on the resnet50 model to train a dataset of 'cats/dogs'. Link to the code below.....

# Day 8
Implemented transfer learning on a few real world datasets. Learnt about Train_data_generators in keras and used it to train the dog breed classifier. Used python to make nested folders and to sort the pictures of different breeds of dogs in different folders for it to be used with train data generator.

# Day 9
Used transfer learning to train the dog breed classifier on MobileNet. Achieved an accuracy of 77% in the training set but not much accuracy on the test set.

# Day 10
Attended Week 2 of ML Code Jam by Google and Kerala AI. Met a few freelancers in the field and interracted with them. Got to know about several hackathons and methods to learn ML.

# Day 11
Attempted training the dog breed classifier in a kaggle kernel. Attended a meetup and met a lot of people. Planning on submitting the predictions of the test dataset of the dog breed clkassification competition. Code will be posted in the './code' folder.

# Day 12 
Took a break from coding today. Went through a couple of repositories. Revised neural style transfer. Planing on implementing it tomorrow.

# August 14-August 21
Took a break. Could not find time everyday. (Kerala Floods)
