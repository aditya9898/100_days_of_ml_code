# 100_days_of_ml_code
attempting the #100_days_of_ml_code challenge inspired by Siraj Raval

# Day 1
revised tensorflow from scratch. created a program to train a model on the fashion-mnist data set. However not being able to train for over a few epochs. Working on it. code in the 'code' folder.

# Day 2
attained 96% accuracy on the fashion-mnist dataset and debugged tensorflow code. code to the working ipnb linked below.

# Day 3
attended the ml code jam workshop conducted by Google. Learnt about tf.estimators and intro to tensorflow.

# Day 4
Revised keras modes and made a 3 layer conv model to fit the fashion mnist dataset. Attained 90% accuracy on both test and train sets. Have to learn why batch normalization affects the training of conv nets so much.

# Day 5
Created a convolutional neural net in tensorflow and trained a model on the fashion-mnist dataset. A few errors left to debug. Once finnished, will do an analysis on which architecture is best suited to train a model on fashion-mnist.
